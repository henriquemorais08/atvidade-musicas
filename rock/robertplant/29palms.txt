A fool in love - a crazy situation
Her velvet glove knocks me down and down and down and down
Her kiss of fire - a loaded invitation
Inside her smile she takes me down and down and down and down
Her moves look good - a touch of desperation
From where I stood, she turned my head around, 'round and'round

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you
29 Palms - I feel the heat of your desert heart
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you

Oh, I'm burning in love - strange infatuation
Why a cold cold touch - what must I do and do and do and do
The heat and the dust increase my desolation
In God we trust - always for you and you and you and you

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
29 Palms - I feel the heat of your desert heart
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, don't ya know it, baby now
29 Palms - I feel the heat of your desert heart
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you

I'm comin' home
Gonna get there, gonna get there
Don't ya know it, baby

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down the road that leads back...
29 Palms
