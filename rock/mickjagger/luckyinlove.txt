A betting fool
A gambling man
No sooner up
You're down again
Mama said you won't get hurt
Don't play the cards
You won't get burned
But there's a place where I still win
But there's no money in this thing
The game of hearts puts me in spades
The only game I've got it made
Oh I'm lucky in love
Yes I've got the winning touch
Lucky in love
Suddenly I'm dangerous
I'm betting on a filly down at the track
A natural born winner that's a fact
A hundred yards from the winning post
The horse fell down must have seen a ghost
But there's a place where I still win
That is still my sure fire thing
Ooh I will play the Jack of Spades
You play the Queen
I'll play the knave
Oh I'm lucky in love
Yes I've got the winning touch
Lucky in love
Suddenly I'm dangerous
I know it's a mystery
When the numbers come up
Cause mathematics is Greek to me
But I'm lucky, I'm lucky
I'm lucky in love
Yeah Las Vegas at night at the roulette wheel
Yeah Monte Carlo try to cut a deal
Atlantic City I lose at craps
Back in London try to win it back
And late at night I lay in bed
With a pistol to my head
Swear I couldn't take no more
And in she walks right through my door
Oh I'm lucky in love
When I think I've had enough
Lucky in love
Yes I've got the winning touch
Suddenly I'm dangerous
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Lucky with the ladies
Thank God for the ladies
Otherwise I'd go, I'd go crazy
How about a line of credit
For say ten thousand dollars
Eighteen on the red
Put me, put me home to bed baby
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Yes I'm lucky, yes I'm lucky
Lucky with the ladies
I'm sitting here with a full house you know
I just can't just can't lose out on this
Okay, okay your ten thousand
And ten thousand more
Oh you want to raise me
You want to raise me
How about this
Twenty thousand and twenty thousand more
Okay you want to see me
Well I got, I got a full house
What's that
A royal flush
Well ain't that a bust
I'm broke
